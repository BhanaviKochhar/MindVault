# MindVault

MindVault is your AI-powered cognitive companion â€” a second brain that helps you capture, organize, and retrieve your personal knowledge with ease and meaning.

## Project Overview

MindVault is a Personal Knowledge Operating System (PKOS). It is designed to support efficient knowledge capture, structured organization, semantic search, and AI-assisted retrieval. It serves as a digital extension of the mind, helping users retain, reflect on, and reuse what matters most.

## Technology Stack

Frontend: React and Tailwind CSS  
Backend: Flask (or optionally Node.js)  
Database: PostgreSQL and FAISS (or Pinecone for vector storage)  
AI APIs: OpenAI and HuggingFace Transformers

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/BhanaviKochhar/MindVault.git  
cd MindVault

2. Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your machine:  
- Git  
- Python 3.x  
- Node.js and npm  
- PostgreSQL  
- Docker (optional but recommended)
